# Didactic implementation of LDA

This is a didactic implementation of LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) which aims to provide an explicative and unoptimized code (as mush as possible).
It exploits the collapsed Gibbs sampling to infer the latent variables.

# Python environment
I reccomend to execute this code in a Python 2.7 virtual environment, which can be set up using the provided "requirements.txt" file.

1. Create your environment "venv": 
virtualenv venv

2. Activate it:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the didactic LDA:
python my_lda.py

and enjoy LDA!
