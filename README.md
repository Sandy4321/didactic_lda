# Didactic implementation of LDA

This is a didactic implementation of LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) which aims to provide an explicative implementation (as mush as possible).
It exploits the collapsed Gibbs sampling to infer the latent variables.

# Python enviroment
I reccomend to use this code in a Python 2.7 virtual enviroment, which you can set up using the provided "requirements.txt" file.

1. Create your enviroment "venv": 
virtualenv venv

2. Activate it:
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install the required libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

and enjoy LDA!
